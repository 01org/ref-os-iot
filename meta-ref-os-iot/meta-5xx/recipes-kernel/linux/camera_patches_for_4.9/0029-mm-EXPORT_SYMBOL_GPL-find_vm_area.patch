Subject: [PATCH 29/42] mm: EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(find_vm_area);

find_vm_area() is needed in implementing the DMA mapping API as a module,
for one needs to find the struct vm_struct corresponding to a virtual
address when the DMA memory is released.

Device specific IOMMUs with associated DMA mapping implementations should
be buildable as modules.
